This package is built on the new classes `haven_labelled` and
`haven_labelled_spss` introduced by `haven` package to handle labelled
variables imported from SPSS, Stata and SAS. The `labelled` package
propose several functions to manipulate such vectors and their metadata:
variable labels, value labels and user-defined missing values.

## Installation

From CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("labelled")
```

Development version from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("larmarange/labelled")
```

## Some general guidelines

1.  Functions are intended to support `labelled` metadata structures
    only. However, `to_labelled()` method allows to convert metadata
    from **foreign** and **memisc** packages.
2.  Functions should, by default, modify metadata only (i.e.Â classes and
    attributes), except if explicitly expressed by the user.
